## Building Without Apps in the AI Era

---

## 1. Core Belief

I believe the future is not about building full apps.

The future is about:
- APIs
- Extensions
- Plugins
- OS-level hooks
- Agents that act at the moment of decision

Apps are destinations.

I want to be infrastructure.

## 2. Fixed Target

**Target: Bio-hacker × High-performer**

This target is fixed.

They:
- Already track biometric data (Oura, Whoop, Garmin, Apple Watch)
- Are highly self-aware
- Make many decisions every day
- Regret decisions made under fatigue or stress
- Are tired of installing new apps
- Are open to tools that embed into existing workflows

I am not looking for "users".

I am looking for **decision moments**.

---

## 3. How I Define the Problem

Users do not say:
- "I need a biometric decision system"
- "I want AI to decide for me"

They say:
- "I don't trust my state today"
- "I always make bad calls when I'm tired"
- "I wish something stopped me before I messed this up"

The problem is not *what* to decide.

The problem is *when* decisions are made.

## 4. What I Will NOT Build

- ❌ A standalone consumer app
- ❌ Another dashboard
- ❌ A habit tracker
- ❌ A productivity coach
- ❌ A system that replaces human judgment

Apps create friction.

Dashboards create hindsight.

I want **interruption and timing**.

---

## 5. What I WILL Build

For each pain point, I will create multiple solution hypotheses using:
- Browser extensions
- OS-level widgets
- Menu bar tools
- CLI tools
- Bots (Telegram, Slack, WhatsApp)
- APIs embedded into other tools
- Agent-driven workflows

Each solution must:
- Intervene before a bad decision
- Require minimal user effort
- Live where the decision already happens
- Be disposable if it doesn't work

---

## 6. Pain → Solution Hypothesis Model

For a fixed target:
- Problems repeat
- Contexts repeat
- Interfaces change

I will:
1. Fix the target
2. List recurring pain statements
3. Generate multiple solution hypotheses per pain
4. Build the fastest interface first
5. Kill it quickly if it doesn't work
6. Keep what survives as API-level infrastructure

---

## 7. Food, Data, and External APIs

If a decision depends on nutrition, stress, or context:
- I will not ask users to open another app
- I will pull data from existing sources

Examples:
- MyFitnessPal API
- Food photo → Vision API → nutrition estimate
- Calendar context
- Message content (pre-send)
- Biometric signals

Data should flow to the decision.

Not the other way around.

---

## 8. Influence: AI-Native Development

I strongly resonate with the idea that:
- Apps will disappear
- APIs will remain
- Agents will orchestrate everything

My role is not to write perfect code.

My role is to:
- Design the system
- Define the architecture
- Decide *where* intelligence should live

I optimize for:
- Speed over perfection
- Architecture over code style
- Shipping over polishing
- Learning over planning

---

## 9. Personal Reflection

I enjoy building.

I enjoy shipping.

I enjoy deleting things that don't work.

The AI era rewards:
- People who love launching
- People who think in systems
- People who can let go of control

I believe this is my time.
