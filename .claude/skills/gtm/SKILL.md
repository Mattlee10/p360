# GTM Content Skill

Create content for bio-hacker audience following P360 communication principles.

## Content Principles

### Show, Don't Tell
- NO: Explain what you're building
- YES: Show screenshot, demo, output

### Start with Conclusion
```
Conclusion → Evidence → Optional context
```

### S + V + Num
- Simple: No jargon
- Verifiable: Can be checked
- Numeric: Grounded in numbers

## Content Types

### Reddit Post (r/Biohackers, r/QuantifiedSelf)

```
[TITLE]: [Specific outcome] + [How you achieved it]

I [specific action] and [specific result with numbers].

Here's what I learned:

```

### Twitter/X Thread

```
Tweet 1: [Hook + conclusion]
Tweet 2-4: [Evidence with numbers]
Tweet 5: [Call to action or question]
```

### DM/Outreach

Before sending, check:
- [ ] Am I showing something real?
- [ ] Is there clear value for them?
- [ ] S + V + Num?

```
